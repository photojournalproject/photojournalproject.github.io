<h4>A river near my home</h4>
		<p> I found this place while taking a tram back home. I was amazed by how quiet and close to my house it was at the same time. 
		I promised myself to visit again, and took this photograph, which is my current wallpaper. I've actually came to the location 
		on several occasions since then. I would sit there and reflect for hours, while looking at the lake. </p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>I took this picture with a cheap camera, so it needed some color correction to improve its' quality. The original can be seen by 
		hovering the mouse over the photo.</p> </div>

<h4>Coffee with my friends</h4>
		<p>My close friend took this picture of me enjoying coffee. I really love it because it brings back all those sunny summer days. I also miss my short, red hair.  </p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>I slightly changed the colours and cropped the picture a little bit to make it look better.</p> </div>

<h4>Grandparents' village</h4>
		<p> I took this lovely image in my grandparents' village, in which nature is absolutely stunning. During one of my strolls, 
		I decided to visit the highest peak in the surrounding area. The beautiful fields on my way inspired me to capture this scene in a photo. </p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>This photograph was acceptable to begin with, but I used my color correction skills to make it appear more detailed.

<h4>23.08.2023r.</h4> 
<h4>Abandoned factory</h4>
		<p>  This picture was a gem that I discovered on Google Maps during summer. It was an abandoned synthetic gasoline factory, however, 
		due to the efforts of a local organisation, the buildings were in good condition. Me and my friend decided to go to explore the roof of the main 
		facility from where the views were breathtaking. It was an extraordinary day.
		<p> </p>
		<p>The middle part of the picture was quite dark and monotonous, so I made it lighter and more detailed.
		Moreover, I sectioned my friend out	and made her more visible. Finally, I made similar adjustments to the building in the background as well. 
		The original can be seen by hovering the mouse over the photo.

<h4>Sunrise by the river</h4>
		<p>  During the weekend, my friend and I decided that we should make the most of our free time. That's why we decided to get up early, 
		around 6 o'clock and see the breathtaking sunrise overlooking a nearby lake. My friend was covered in sun streaks so beautifully, 
		that I had the urge to capture it in an image.
		</p> <p> </p>
		<p>Unfortunately, my friend was not visible in the original photograph, which prompted me to edit it. By framing and lightening, I successfully made 
		her the main element of the picture. The original can be seen by hovering the mouse over the photo.

<h4>Jogging on the fields</h4>
		<p>  I recently took this image while running near my house. This stunning view made me aware of how close we are to nature's beauty.
		</p> <p> </p>
		<p>Unfortunately, the original image had an undesirable glow in the top left corner. However, during the photo editing process,
		I was able to remove it. I also cropped this image and improved its colours. The original can be seen by hovering the mouse over the photo.

<h4>My friend's perspective</h4>
		<p> During one of our trips, one of my closest friends took this picture of me while we were admiring the beauty of the local countryside. 
		I immediately liked the image since it highlighted my relationship with nature.  </p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>To enhance its appearance, I improved the sky color and the grass texture, emphasising the importance of nature in this photograph.

<h4>02.11.2023r.</h4> 
<h4>An autumn bouquet</h4>
		<p> In November I walked through my grandparents' village and came across a huge field of autumn flowers. I was so impressed with nature's 
		beauty, that I decided to gather some of the flowers and create a bouquet. I thought it'd be a shame not to share this little artwork 
		with my loved ones, so I took a picture of it.  </p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>To add an extra touch of loveliness to the image, I enhanced the colours of the autumn flowers and removed my hand from the picture.

<h4>04.11.2023r.</h4> 
<h4>Really sweet orange cat</h4>
		<p> When I was in my grandparents' village, my cat was being taken care of by my neighbour. I knew he was in good hands, but I missed him 
		very much. Then I met this sweet orange cat on the street. I stopped to watch him and he was licking himself for 30 minutes! 
		I thought he was really adorable and I took this picture to show to my friend, who is an absolute cat lover.  </p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>This photo came out a little bit too dark, so I had to lighten it and apply some color correction.

<h4>A lake on a foggy day</h4>
		<p> This photograph was taken on a family camera, and the moment I captured it, it brought back many pleasant memories. 
		The adorable wooden bridge in the foreground reminded me of summer. 
		</p> <p> </p>
		<p>I wanted the trees at the background to be more visible and the water's hue to be deeper, so I used some color correction options.
		The original can be seen by hovering the mouse over the photo.
